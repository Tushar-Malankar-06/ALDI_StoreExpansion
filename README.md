# 🏪 ALDI Store Expansion Analysis – Indiana

This project identifies optimal locations in Indiana for ALDI to expand its grocery store presence using data-driven insights. The analysis was conducted as part of the final project for **MGMT 58200: Management of Organizational Data** at Purdue University.

## 📌 Objective

To assist ALDI in strategically expanding across Indiana by analyzing:

- Foot traffic and consumer behavior
- Grocery store density
- Dwell times
- Per capita income
- Demographic and economic indicators

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Counties with ALDI**: Higher store density and longer dwell times.
- **Counties without ALDI**: Lower store density but surprisingly high footfall.
- **Income hotspots**: Morgan County (without ALDI) and Porter County (with ALDI) both show strong purchasing power.
- **City-level targets**:
  - **West Lafayette** (Tippecanoe) – high traffic, strong university presence.
  - **Monrovia** (Morgan) – proximity to Indianapolis, high income, and steady traffic.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. Categorized Indiana counties by ALDI presence (43 with, 40 without).
2. Ranked each group by footfall, dwell time, and grocery density.
3. Filtered top 3 counties from each group based on income.
4. Evaluated population patterns and local economic health to finalize recommendations.

## 📊 Tools & Techniques

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Publicly available foot traffic and income datasets
- Geospatial filtering and visualization
- Comparative data segmentation and ranking
